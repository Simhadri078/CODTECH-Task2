### **Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression **

### **Project:Predictive Modeling With Linear Regression Project Overview**

#### **Overview :**
This project focuses on building a simple linear regression model to predict continuous target variables using the Boston Housing dataset. The goal is to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes based on the average number of rooms per dwelling.

#### **Objective:**
The main objectives of this project are:
1. To develop a linear regression model that can predict the median value of homes.
2. To split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
3. To assess the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).
4. To visualize the regression line and the comparison between actual vs. predicted values.

#### **Key Activities:**

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:**
   - Load the Boston Housing dataset.
   - Display the first few rows and understand the dataset's structure.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Select relevant features and target variables.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Train a linear regression model using the training data.

4. **Model Prediction and Evaluation:**
   - Make predictions on the test data.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using MSE and R-squared metrics.

5. **Visualization:**
   - Visualize the regression line.
   - Plot actual vs. predicted values to assess model accuracy.

#### **Technologies Used:**

- **Programming Language:**
  - Python

- **Libraries:**
  - **pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
  - **numpy:** Numerical operations.
  - **matplotlib:** Data visualization.
  - **seaborn:** Statistical data visualization.
  - **scikit-learn:** Machine learning and model evaluation.

#### **Key Insights:**

- **Data Exploration:**
  - The dataset contains features related to housing attributes with `MEDV` as the target variable.
  - The `RM` feature (average number of rooms per dwelling) was selected to predict `MEDV`.

- **Model Performance:**
  - The Mean Squared Error (MSE) measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values. Lower MSE indicates better performance.
  - The R-squared (R²) metric indicates the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model. An R² value closer to 1 indicates a better fit.

- **Visualization:**
  - The regression line plot shows how well the model fits the data.
  - The actual vs. predicted values plot helps visualize the accuracy and identify any discrepancies.
